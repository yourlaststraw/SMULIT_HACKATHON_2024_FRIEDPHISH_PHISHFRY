# mechanism of the code
This code is designed to analyze URLs and web page content within a Chrome extension, primarily for phishing detection. It normalizes URLs, extracts domain information, and computes various features such as protocol type, host length, directory complexity, and resource distances between the page's URL and its linked resources. By comparing these features, it can identify potential phishing sites by detecting unusual patterns or inconsistencies in the URLs and page structure. The script also includes a listener that responds to requests by providing a feature vector for the analyzed web page.
